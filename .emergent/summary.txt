<analysis>
The AI engineer's work involved iteratively developing an iPhone overtime tracking app. Initial efforts focused on setting up Expo, FastAPI, and MongoDB, implementing core features like work session tracking, location monitoring, notifications, email sending, and various schedule input methods. Significant challenges included fixing timezone issues, refining location permissions, transitioning from Outlook to Gmail SMTP, and continuously improving the AI-powered schedule parsing from PDFs/images. The  frontend component and backend AI prompts () underwent multiple refactorings. More recently, the focus shifted to fixing CSV upload parsing, addressing permission popups, and tackling persistent deployment issues on Railway due to  and  dependency conflicts. The latest interactions are centered around resolving these deployment blockers.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an iPhone overtime tracking app capable of background operation. Key features include:
*   Configurable vibration/beep reminders to photograph completed work at session end (repeating every 15 minutes).
*   Automatic email sending with editable content (subject: prasau apmoketi uz virsvalandzius) upon exiting a geofence, including attached work photos.
*   Work start/end times parsed from monthly schedules uploaded as PDFs, later refined to CSV/TXT files via an external AI (ChatGPT converting image to file) due to internal AI limitations.
*   The app must be side-loadable.
*   Refinements: Gmail SMTP, LLM for parsing (initially Emergent, later simplified), local storage for photos, periodic 5-minute location checks, configurable email template, geofence radius, overtime threshold, auto/manual email send modes, fixing a 3-hour timezone discrepancy, editing past schedules, fixing schedule upload/camera issues, correcting Lithuanian UI text. Most recently, fixing multi-month schedule parsing for CSV, adjusting overtime calculation, resolving permission pop-ups, enabling timezone selection, and ensuring single email sending.

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve persistent Railway deployment failures caused by dependency conflicts ( and ).
-   Verify that all uploaded schedules (especially multi-month CSVs) are correctly displayed and editable, and that the Dabartinis grafikas section accurately reflects all parsed days.
-   Ensure permission pop-ups are displayed only once per session or when absolutely necessary, not after every photo.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was attempting to deploy the backend to Railway.app. The deployment was failing due to dependency conflicts, specifically with  requiring  while the  specified .

Previously, the engineer had addressed several user issues:
1.  **Email Content & Timezone**: Corrected email content to reflect scheduled start/end times instead of actual button press times, and implemented Lithuania timezone correction for  in emails.
2.  **Overtime Calculation**: Fixed the logic to correctly calculate overtime based on scheduled end time vs. actual end time.
3.  **Timezone UI**: Added a  selector to the frontend  and the backend  model.
4.  **Multi-month CSV/Excel/TXT Upload**: Implemented backend logic () to handle user-provided CSV format (day numbers + year/month) and multi-month schedules. Frontend () was updated to allow selection of month/year during upload and removed the display limit on Upcoming work days.
5.  **Permission Pop-ups**: Attempted to make permission requests for camera and location less intrusive in  by using a silent mode and preventing repeated alerts.
6.  **Double Emails**: Attempted to fix the issue where two emails were sent by modifying the  logic in .

The most recent activity involves troubleshooting the Railway deployment failure. The engineer identified the conflict, removed  (as it's a private package), and attempted to fix  by loosening version constraints. However, the latest error message indicates that the old  dependency (which requires a specific  version) is still causing conflicts during the Railway build process, suggesting the  change wasn't fully effective or propagated.

<optional_next_step>
Verify that  is completely removed from  and its transitive dependencies, then commit and push the corrected file to trigger a new Railway deployment.
