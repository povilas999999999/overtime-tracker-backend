The AI engineer successfully built an iPhone overtime tracking application from scratch based on detailed user requirements. The development followed an iterative process, addressing user feedback through multiple rounds of bug fixes and feature enhancements. Initial setup involved configuring Expo for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for the database, along with essential package installations. Key challenges included correctly handling iOS location permissions, transitioning from Outlook to Gmail SMTP for email sending, resolving timezone discrepancies, implementing various schedule input methods (PDF, image-to-text, manual), and ensuring robust UI/UX for core features. The engineer frequently engaged in debugging, especially around email configuration, navigation, and location services. Most recently, the focus has been on refining schedule management, specifically addressing issues with PDF/image uploads, camera freezes, and enabling editing of scheduled work times. The current task involves a comprehensive rewrite of the  component to resolve these persistent issues, followed by an Expo restart.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an iPhone application to track overtime, operating in the background during selected periods. Upon work-end, the app must trigger a configurable vibration/beep reminder to photograph completed work. Reminders repeat every 15 minutes (configurable duration). Exiting a defined geofence (work location) automatically sends an email to a pre-configured address with an editable text, detailing overtime duration. The email subject should be prasau apmoketi uz virsvalandzius (please pay for overtime), including attached work photos. Work start/end times are parsed from monthly PDF schedules via AI, with a prompt to upload. The app must be side-loadable, not from the App Store.

Subsequent refinements included:
*   Using a personal email account for sending (initially Outlook, later switched to Gmail).
*   AI-powered PDF parsing requiring an LLM (using Emergent LLM key).
*   Local device storage for photos (base64 format).
*   Always Allow background location permissions, active only during work end hours, later refined to periodic checks every 5 minutes instead of constant geofencing.
*   Capability to edit the automatic email content template.
*   Ability to specify the geofence radius.
*   Option to configure an overtime threshold (minutes after work end before email sends).
*   Fixing a 3-hour timezone discrepancy in recorded work start times.
*   Adding an option in settings to send overtime emails automatically or with a prompt.
*   Implementing audible/vibration reminders at work end.
*   Allowing editing of previously entered work times/schedules.
*   Fixing issues with PDF upload, image gallery upload, and camera freezing for schedule input.
*   Correcting Lithuanian UI text (Artejancios darbo dienos instead of Artejantys).

<code_architecture>

The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: an Expo React Native frontend, a FastAPI Python backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure (Simplified relevant parts):**


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the core FastAPI backend logic. It defines API endpoints for managing app settings, work sessions (start/stop), location data, schedule uploads (PDF, image-to-text, manual input), and email sending.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified throughout the trajectory. Initial setup for CRUD operations, then updates for email SMTP configuration (Outlook to Gmail), adding fields to  model (email template, geofence radius, overtime threshold, reminder settings, email send mode), implementing schedule upload endpoints (, ), fixing backend logic for timezone handling, and adding endpoints for editing work sessions and schedules. It also includes the integration with the LLM via  for PDF/image parsing.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables for backend configuration, notably MongoDB connection string and email SMTP credentials.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to switch from Outlook SMTP to Gmail SMTP, including , , , and  (App Password). Debugged issues related to spaces in the app password.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main screen and entry point for the application's core functionality, managing work session status, location tracking, notifications, and interaction with the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Significantly modified to handle location permission requests (foreground/background), transition from geofencing to periodic 5-minute location checks, implement the end-of-day photo reminders, fix the 3-hour timezone issue by sending frontend timestamps, and integrate the auto/manual email send logic based on user settings.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Defines the global layout and navigation structure using Expo Router, typically wrapping the main app content.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created as part of the initial project setup to establish file-based routing.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The user interface for configuring application settings such as reminder intervals, email recipients, email template, geofence radius, overtime threshold, email send mode, and reminder frequency.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and then repeatedly rewritten (using ) to add new input fields for , , ,  (auto/manual), , . It also includes logic to save/load these settings from the backend.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Handles the camera functionality for capturing photos of completed work.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to resolve a navigation error (GO_BACK not handled) by replacing  with  to ensure a valid navigation target.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages the input and display of work schedules, including uploading PDF, recognizing text from images, and manual entry.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created initially, then extensively refactored multiple times. Updates focused on implementing manual schedule entry, image-to-text recognition, fixing issues with PDF/image uploads (FileSystem, deprecated APIs), addressing camera freezing, and adding functionality to edit existing schedule entries. The last action was a complete rewrite of this file.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing multiple user-reported issues related to schedule management. These included errors when attempting to upload PDF files for schedules, gallery images failing to upload, the camera freezing when trying to photograph a schedule, and the inability to edit manually entered work schedules.

The AI engineer identified several underlying problems: a  issue for PDF uploads, deprecated APIs for image pickers, and potential large file handling issues for the camera. To comprehensively fix these, and to implement the requested schedule editing functionality, the AI engineer decided to perform a complete rewrite of the  file.

The last action recorded was the successful creation of this new  file, followed by a recognition of a cache problema and a subsequent restart of the Expo frontend service. The new  is expected to incorporate fixes for the upload issues, better error handling, and the ability to edit schedules as per user requests.
